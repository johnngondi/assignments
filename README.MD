We will be using the following format to name the assignments.

`v[number]/quiz` - This will be the question to be addressed by the student

`v[number]/attempt` - This will be the results of the student's attempt

`v[number]/answer` - This will be the answer provided by the trainer

On the `v[number]/quiz` branch, a photo of the design should be added, and instructions should be provided on the branch's `readme.md` file.
=======
> NOTE: Do all your work in the `index.html` file herein.

Before you begin, open a new branch named `v1/attempt`

Once done, `commit` your work with a proper message then `push` it.
